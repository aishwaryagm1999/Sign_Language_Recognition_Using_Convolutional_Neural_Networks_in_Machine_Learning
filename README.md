# Sign_Language_Recognition_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_in_Machine_Learning

This project was created using Convolutional Neural Networks Model to predict the sign language shown by user towards the camera as its respective Natural Language Alphabet (English Alphabets in this project). The project will help individuals with Hearing or Speaking impairments to communicate easily with other people.
Python,OpenCV and Tensorflow models and libraries were used during the model training and testing processes.
LabelImg tool was used to label the captured dataset images.

The updated code for this project (Main code, Image Capture code and LabelMap code) are uploaded in this repository.

The installation process for all dependancies, softwares and process flow are found in the link below along with complete tutorial on how to develop sign language recognition models.

This Project was developed from another project : Link -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDXdlXlaCco
