# Sign_Language_Recognition_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_in_Machine_Learning

This project was created using Convolutional Neural Networks Model to predict the sign language shown by user towards the camera as its respective Natural Language Alphabet (English Alphabets in this project). The project will help individuals with Hearing or Speaking impairments to communicate easily with other people.
Python,OpenCV and Tensorflow models and libraries were used during the model training and testing processes.
LabelImg tool was used to label the captured dataset images.

This Project was developed from another project : Link -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDXdlXlaCco
